#### Description

GitHub can help you access lots of data about projects and developers in your organization. Data can be a powerful tool in tracking productivity, but it can also encourage unproductive behaviors. Knowing what to track is often the biggest challenge.

In this workshop, you'll learn which metrics your team should be watching, and how to collect and visualize them to help developers work more efficiently and collaboratively.
